  <h2> Who am I? </h2>
  <p> I am a Principal Backend Developer working @ <a href="https://cellosignal.com/" target="_blank">Signal</a> living in Edinburgh (UK). 
    Passionate about my work, I am a problem solver and a constant learner. Even though I like the technical part of my job, I also love the human part of it: it's really rewarding to see the improvements in a team. </p>
